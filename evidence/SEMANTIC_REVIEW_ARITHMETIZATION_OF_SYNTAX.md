# Semantic review: Arithmetization of Syntax

Review date: 2026-09-09

Locale: `bn-Beng-IN`

Units: OLP-0280--OLP-0288
Scope: 116 aligned source/target blocks across the chapter driver, introduction, coding of symbols, terms and formulas, substitution, and the LK, natural-deduction and axiomatic proof-coding sections.

This review records the semantic pass completed before reader integration. The Bengali text was read against the frozen English blocks in source order and reverse-paraphrased at the level of definitions, recursive clauses, bounds, proof-object layouts and exercises. Every source/target pair passed the checked structural policy: block counts, audited mathematical fragments, control sequences, environments, semantic tokens and Unicode NFC. The nine target files remain draft source files; TeX/PDF rendering and final reader pagination are pending because the shared TeX mutex is reserved by another workflow.

## Frozen-source identity

The controlling source is OpenLogic revision `9620cc73f9c8e0ad003c514a5d3748f29611c4c0`. Its 722-unit manifest has SHA-256 `5a6fef5c16c15a5b2f90f874c268512cfd6ed2e846bdfa850a67304a4c05a155`. Index and correction-ledger generation revalidated the per-file source hashes before accepting these units.

## Source-level corrections carried into the Bengali draft

The following thirteen corrections are documented in `SOURCE_CORRECTIONS.jsonl` and marked adjacent to the affected target passages. Correction-note material is excluded from source parity and terminology occurrence counts.

* **BN-SRC-205 (OLP-0284):** the predicate-code condition now requires `\len{z}=n`, so the number of coded arguments equals the predicate arity.
* **BN-SRC-206 (OLP-0284):** the proof no longer claims that the whole formation-sequence code is below the formula code. It bounds the subformula codes and derives a primitive-recursive bound for the combined sequence code.
* **BN-SRC-207 (OLP-0284):** the `FreeOcc` implication lies inside both bounded quantifier scopes in the definition of `Sent`.
* **BN-SRC-208 (OLP-0286):** the expanded LK example drops the unmatched right parenthesis after the initial sequent code.
* **BN-SRC-209 (OLP-0286):** the end-sequent helper is consistently named `\fn{EndSequent}`.
* **BN-SRC-210 (OLP-0286):** the final initial-sequent alternative calls the defined `\fn{InitSeq}`, and its explanation refers to the running derivation code `$p$`.
* **BN-SRC-211 (OLP-0286):** the derivation test consistently uses `$p$` and closes the final `\fn{Correct}` application.
* **BN-SRC-212 (OLP-0286):** the unique succedent formula has Gödel number `$y$`; `$x$` remains the derivation code.
* **BN-SRC-213 (OLP-0287):** immediate subderivations occupy slots `$(d')_{j+1}$`, after the count stored in slot zero.
* **BN-SRC-214 (OLP-0287):** the incomplete subsequence sentence explicitly names `\fn{SubtreeSeq}(d)` as the controlling sequence.
* **BN-SRC-215 (OLP-0288):** the previous-line index in the `\fn{QR}_1` condition is bound by `\bexists{j<i}`.
* **BN-SRC-216 (OLP-0288):** the nonoccurrence wording is repaired and the code bound consistently refers to the constant `$c$`.
* **BN-SRC-217 (OLP-0288):** the recursive nested-conditional definition calls its defined helper `\fn{hCond}` rather than the undefined three-argument `\fn{Cond}`.

## Reverse-paraphrase checks

1. **Chapter driver and introduction:** the Bengali driver imports the introduction and seven technical sections in the frozen order. The introduction assigns natural numbers to symbols and then to terms, formulas and derivations; it uses those codes to turn syntactic tests and transformations into number-theoretic relations and functions. Substitution remains the motivating example, and arithmetized syntax remains the bridge needed for statements about formal theories to speak about their own proofs.
2. **Symbols and codes:** each primitive symbol receives its fixed code. A string code is built by the stated prime-power convention, concatenation remains an arithmetic operation on string codes, and the numeral construction produces the syntactic numeral corresponding to a natural number. Symbol codes are kept distinct from Gödel numbers of complete terms and formulas.
3. **Terms and formulas:** a well-formed object is recognized by a finite formation sequence whose entries obey the relevant formation clauses. The search is finite because the component codes and sequence length admit primitive-recursive bounds; the review does not rely on the false claim corrected by BN-SRC-206. Predicate codes require exactly the declared number of arguments. `FreeOcc` still identifies an occurrence outside a binding quantifier, and `Sent` still means a formula with no free variable occurrence.
4. **Substitution:** the recursive function copies unaffected symbols, replaces the selected variable where licensed, recurses through compound terms and connectives, and treats quantifiers with the stated capture-avoidance conditions. The “free for” relation remains a syntactic test preventing a formerly free variable occurrence from becoming bound.
5. **LK proof coding:** an LK derivation is represented as a tuple containing immediate subderivations, an end sequent and a last-rule code. `Correct(p)` checks the final inference from the child end sequents, `Deriv(p)` checks every coded subtree, and `\Prf[\Gamma](x,y)` additionally verifies that the left side of the final sequent belongs to `\Gamma` and its right side is the singleton sentence coded by `$y$`.
6. **Natural-deduction proof coding:** a derivation tree records its immediate subderivations, end formula, discharge label and last rule. The subtree sequence lets the definitions inspect every node. Open assumptions are precisely the labelled assumptions not discharged on the path governed by an inference, and the quantified rules retain their eigenvariable conditions. The corrected `j+1` indexing covers all direct children without treating the stored child count as a derivation.
7. **Axiomatic proof coding:** an axiomatic derivation is a finite sequence whose line is a premise, an axiom-schema instance, a modus-ponens consequence of earlier lines or a quantified-rule consequence satisfying its nonoccurrence condition. The recursive conditional constructor converts a finite premise sequence into a right-associated conditional with the target sentence as consequent. The deduction theorem then connects a proof from those premises with a proof of that nested conditional from the empty premise set.

## Terminology and authority scope

Decisions BN-IN-T234, BN-IN-T235, BN-IN-T236, BN-IN-T237, BN-IN-T238, BN-IN-T239, BN-IN-T240, BN-IN-T241 and BN-IN-T242 record the chapter vocabulary for Gödel numbering, formation sequences, primitive recursion, proof-object fields, discharge, subderivations, axiomatic rules, nested conditionals and substitution. The linked canon pages were read for India-standard Bengali mathematical, logic, sequence, relation, function, variable and proof prose. They support the surrounding register and some component words; they do not directly establish every OpenLogic-specific compound. Formal correctness therefore rests on the frozen-source comparison, the displayed definitions and the explicit BN-SRC-205--BN-SRC-217 audits. All nine decisions remain provisional and open to expert correction.

## Validation state

The full source checker passes all 287 current target units, including these 116 blocks. The next release gate is a durable 287-unit verifier followed by the public commit and anonymous immutable-archive readback. TeX compilation, PDF rendering, pagination and reader visual review remain pending while the shared TeX mutex is unavailable; no build result is inferred from source alignment.
